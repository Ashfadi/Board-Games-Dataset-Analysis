# Board Games Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project involves cleaning, analyzing, and extracting insights from a dataset about board games, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/board-games). The dataset contains information on thousands of board games, including their ratings, player requirements, playtime, and game mechanics. The objective is to explore the dataset using **Pandas** and generate meaningful insights.

---

## Objectives
1. Clean the dataset by handling missing values, invalid data, and inconsistent data types.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to answer specific questions about board games.
3. Use Pythonâ€™s Pandas library to manipulate the dataset efficiently without loops or conditional statements.
4. Extract insights related to game complexity, player preferences, and domain-specific trends.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.

## Dataset Details
- **Source**: [Kaggle: Board Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/board-games)
- **Columns**:
  - `ID`: Unique identifier for the game.
  - `Name`: Name of the board game.
  - `Year Published`: Year the game was published.
  - `Min Players` and `Max Players`: Minimum and maximum players required for the game.
  - `Play Time`: Average playtime of the game (in minutes).
  - `Min Age`: Minimum recommended age for players.
  - `Users Rated`: Number of users who rated the game.
  - `Rating Average`: Average rating given to the game by users.
  - `BGG Rank`: BoardGameGeek ranking of the game.
  - `Complexity Average`: Average complexity score of the game.
  - `Owned Users`: Number of users who own the game.
  - `Mechanics` and `Domains`: Lists of game mechanics and domains.

## Key Tasks and Insights

### **Task 1: Handle Missing and Invalid Data**
- Identified columns with null values:
  - `ID`, `Year Published`, `Owned Users`, `Mechanics`, and `Domains`.
- Replaced missing values:
  - Used `5000` for missing years and `-1` for missing owned user counts.
- Converted data types for proper analysis.

### **Task 2: Identify Games Published Before 1900**
- Found the number of games published before 1900 (excluding year 0 as it indicates missing data).
- Example Output:
  - Total games published before 1900: **111**
  - Oldest game: **Senet**

### **Task 3: Analyze Popularity by Minimum Players**
- Computed the average ownership for games based on the `Min Players` column.
- Observed that games with fewer minimum players tend to have higher ownership.

### **Task 4: Examine Rating and Complexity**
- Created pivot tables to analyze relationships between `Rating Average` and `Complexity Average`.
- Found a positive correlation:
  - Games with higher complexity tend to have higher ratings.

### **Task 5: Explore Game Domains**
- Used one-hot encoding on the `Domains` column to determine the frequency of each domain type.
- Example Output:
  - Most common domain: **Wargames** (3316 games).
  - Least common domain: **Customizable Games** (297 games).
