# Board Games Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project involves cleaning, analyzing, and extracting insights from a dataset about board games, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/board-games). The dataset contains information on thousands of board games, including their ratings, player requirements, playtime, and game mechanics. The objective is to explore the dataset using **Pandas** and generate meaningful insights.

---

## Objectives
1. Clean the dataset by handling missing values, invalid data, and inconsistent data types.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to answer specific questions about board games.
3. Use Python’s Pandas library to manipulate the dataset efficiently without loops or conditional statements.
4. Extract insights related to game complexity, player preferences, and domain-specific trends.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.

## Dataset Details
- **Source**: [Kaggle: Board Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/board-games)
- **Columns**:
  - `ID`: Unique identifier for the game.
  - `Name`: Name of the board game.
  - `Year Published`: Year the game was published.
  - `Min Players` and `Max Players`: Minimum and maximum players required for the game.
  - `Play Time`: Average playtime of the game (in minutes).
  - `Min Age`: Minimum recommended age for players.
  - `Users Rated`: Number of users who rated the game.
  - `Rating Average`: Average rating given to the game by users.

## Key Tasks and Insights

### **Task 1: Handle Missing and Invalid Data**
- Identified columns with null values:
  - `ID`, `Year Published`, `Owned Users`, `Mechanics`, and `Domains`.
- Replaced missing values:
  - Used `5000` for missing years and `-1` for missing owned user counts.
- Converted data types for proper analysis.

### **Task 2: Identify Games Published Before 1900**
- Found the number of games published before 1900 (excluding year 0 as it indicates missing data).
- Example Output:
  - Total games published before 1900: **111**
  - Oldest game: **Senet**

### **Task 3: Analyze Popularity by Minimum Players**
- Computed the average ownership for games based on the `Min Players` column.
- Observed that games with fewer minimum players tend to have higher ownership.

### **Task 4: Examine Rating and Complexity**
- Created pivot tables to analyze relationships between `Rating Average` and `Complexity Average`.
- Found a positive correlation:
  - Games with higher complexity tend to have higher ratings.

### **Task 5: Explore Game Domains**
- Used one-hot encoding on the `Domains` column to determine the frequency of each domain type.
- Example Output:
  - Most common domain: **Wargames** (3316 games).

To enhance my skills further, I completed certifications on platforms like DataCamp, focusing on Power BI, Tableau, and Python. While I don’t yet have professional or industrial experience, I’ve developed strong analytical skills through my academic projects and freelance work. I’m eager to apply my knowledge to real-world business problems, and I’m especially drawn to Fortis because of its focus on innovation and data-driven decision-making.

You said:
Can you explain in easy words what is etl and from my reusme provide answer where i have used them and what is ad hoc and what is testing and quality assurance 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
1. What is ETL?
ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It is a process used in data management and analysis:

Extract: Pulling raw data from different sources (e.g., databases, websites, or files).
Transform: Cleaning, organizing, and changing the data into a usable format (e.g., fixing errors or calculating new values).
Load: Storing the cleaned and transformed data into a database or system for analysis or reporting.
From Your Resume:
In your projects:

Web Scraping of National Parks: You extracted data from websites (Extract), cleaned it (Transform), and saved it for analysis (Load).
Exploratory Data Analysis on Census Data: You worked with raw data, cleaned and processed it (Transform), and used it for analysis and visualization.
These demonstrate your experience in performing parts of the ETL process.

2. What is Ad Hoc?
"Ad hoc" means "for this specific purpose" or "on-demand." In data analysis, ad hoc analysis refers to analyzing data to answer a specific question or solve a one-time problem. It's not part of regular or routine reporting.

Example from Your Resume:
Your freelance project analyzing patient disenrollment for a healthcare client is an example of ad hoc analysis. You used specific data and machine learning models to answer one question: "Why are patients leaving?"

3. What is Testing and Quality Assurance (QA)?
Testing and Quality Assurance ensure that the data, reports, or dashboards you create are accurate, complete, and work as expected.

Testing: Checking if the output (like dashboards, models, or reports) works correctly.
Example: Testing if a dashboard displays correct numbers for sales figures.
Quality Assurance (QA): Ensuring the entire process—from collecting data to creating dashboards—is done with accuracy and meets the required standards.
Example: Verifying that the data loaded into a BI tool like Tableau matches the original source data.
From Your Resume:
In your academic projects, such as the "Gender Prediction using Machine Learning Models" or "Tumor Grade Classification," you evaluated models using metrics like cross-validation, Dice Score, and F1-Score. This evaluation process is a form of testing and quality assurance to ensure the models work well and produce reliable results.

You said:
He will ask my just these questions which you have mentioned or he can ask technical questions in 30 min interview? I am scared
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Don’t worry! It's completely normal to feel nervous, but being prepared will help boost your confidence. Let me clarify what to expect in a 30-minute interview for a Jr. BI Analyst role:

1. What is likely to happen in a 30-minute interview?
This is usually a preliminary round, which means it’s more about:

Getting to know you: Your background, interests, and motivation for applying.
Understanding your skills: How your education and projects align with the role.
Assessing cultural fit: If you would work well within their team and company.
They may touch on technical topics but won't dive too deep since it's a short interview. The focus will likely be on:

Your understanding of tools like Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI.
How you’ve applied data skills in your academic projects and certifications.
Your problem-solving and communication skills.
2. Could there be technical questions?
Yes, there might be basic technical questions to test your understanding, such as:

ETL concepts: They may ask you to explain ETL or give an example of how you’ve cleaned and organized data (you can mention your census or web scraping projects).
SQL basics: They might ask simple SQL questions like how to filter data or combine two tables.
Data visualization: They may ask how you would use Tableau or Power BI to create dashboards.
Since you’re a junior candidate, they won’t expect you to know everything perfectly. They just want to see how much you understand and if you’re willing to learn.

3. How to prepare?
Here’s a plan to feel more confident:

Practice introducing yourself: Prepare a simple, clear explanation of your background (like the one I wrote earlier).
Review your resume projects: Be ready to talk about how you worked on them and what tools you used. Focus on Python, SQL, and dashboards.
Learn basic SQL queries: For example:
Select specific columns: SELECT column_name FROM table_name;
Filter data: SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Combine tables: JOIN examples.
Understand BI tools: Review your Tableau and Power BI dashboards. Be ready to explain how you would visualize data to make it useful for business leaders.
Prepare for non-technical questions: Questions like “Why Fortis?” or “What are your strengths/weaknesses?”
4. What if I don’t know an answer?
It’s okay! You can say:

“I haven’t worked on that yet, but I’m eager to learn.”
“I’ve studied it in my coursework/certifications, but I’d love to apply it in a real-world setting.”
Interviewers understand you’re new to the field and expect you to learn on the job. What matters is your willingness to learn and enthusiasm for the role.

5. Final Tip: Breathe!
It’s just a conversation. They’re interested in you because of your resume and potential. Approach the interview as an opportunity to showcase your skills and passion.

You’ve got this! Let me know if you need mock questions or further help preparing.

You said:
What is stratified k fold cross validation in short and easy words
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation is a way to test how well a machine learning model works. Here's how it works in simple terms:

The data is divided into K groups (or "folds") for training and testing.
Instead of randomly splitting the data, it keeps the same proportion of classes (e.g., 70% "Yes" and 30% "No") in each fold. This is important for balanced testing, especially if your data has uneven class distributions.
The model is trained and tested K times, using a different fold for testing each time, while the other folds are used for training.
This method ensures that the model is tested fairly on all parts of the data while keeping the class distribution consistent, giving more reliable results.






You said:
What is a portfolio?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
A portfolio is a collection of your work that shows your skills, experiences, and achievements. For a data-related role, it usually includes:

Projects: Examples of data analysis, dashboards, or machine learning models you've worked on.
Code Samples: Python, SQL scripts, or other programming examples.
Visualizations: Dashboards or charts created using tools like Tableau or Power BI.
Links: GitHub repositories or personal websites where your work is displayed.
A portfolio helps employers see what you can do and gives them proof of your abilities. It’s like a practical version of your resume!

# Census Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing U.S. Census data to uncover trends and insights about income, education levels, age distribution, and occupations. The data was cleaned, preprocessed, and visualized using Python libraries.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw census data for analysis.
- Explore demographic trends related to age, education, and income.
- Visualize key findings using plots and charts.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Standardized categorical values (e.g., combining similar categories like 'Federal-gov' and 'State-gov').
   - Removed missing or invalid data points.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Discretized gross income into ranges (`<=50K` and `>50K`).
   - Grouped ages into categories (e.g., `<21`, `21-40`, `41-60`, `>60`).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Created frequency plots to analyze age distributions.
   - Generated pie charts to compare professions by age groups.
   - Grouped and compared education levels by gender.
   - Identified the top 5 occupations.
4. **Visualizations**:
   - Histograms for age distributions.
   - Pie charts for profession distribution.
   - Bar charts comparing education by gender.

## Visualizations
### Example: Frequency Plot for Age Groups
![Age Group Plot](images/age_groups.png)

### Example: Pie Chart for Profession Distribution
![Profession Distribution](images/professions.png)

## Results
- **Income Trends**: Majority of people earning `<=50K` were in specific age and education categories.
- **Education and Gender**: Higher education levels (Masters, Doctorate) were slightly more prevalent among males in older age groups.
- **Top 5 Occupations**:
  - Identified the most common occupations in the dataset.

       'State-gov': 'Government',
       'Self-emp-inc': 'self-employed',
       'Self-emp-not-inc': 'self-employed',
       'Preschool': 'HS-grad',
       '1st-4th': 'HS-grad',
       '5th-6th': 'HS-grad',
       '7th-8th': 'HS-grad',
       '9th': 'HS-grad',
       '10th': 'HS-grad',
       '11th': 'HS-grad',
       '12th': 'HS-grad',
       'Assoc-acdm': 'Bachelors',
       'Assoc-voc': 'Bachelors',
       'Some-college': 'Bachelors',
       'Prof-school': 'Masters'
   }
   df = df.replace(replacements, regex=True)
Use Functions for Repeated Code:
Create a function for reading files or plotting charts to avoid duplication.

# Census Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes U.S. Census data to explore relationships between age, income, education, and professions. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and key insights.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw census data for analysis.
- Explore demographic and income patterns.
- Visualize data to provide actionable insights.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Standardized categorical variables (e.g., combining similar work classes into unified categories).
   - Handled missing data by removing incomplete rows.
   - Discretized income into two groups (`<=50K` and `>50K`).
2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Created histograms to visualize age distribution.
   - Generated pie charts for professions across age groups.

It looks like you've uploaded additional bar chart visualizations for your Census Data Analysis project. Here's how you can incorporate these files into your project and README:

1. Organize Uploaded Files
Place the following files into an images/ directory within your project repository:

barchart_cd.png: Bar chart for education comparison (cleaned data).
barchart_sd.png: Bar chart for education comparison (sample data).
2. Update the README
Enhance your README.md file to include these new visualizations. Here's how to integrate them:

markdown
Copy
Edit
### Example 3: Education Comparison by Gender (Cleaned Data)
![Education Comparison (Cleaned Data)](images/barchart_cd.png)

### Example 4: Education Comparison by Gender (Sample Data)
![Education Comparison (Sample Data)](images/barchart_sd.png)
3. Enhance Project Insights
Expand the insights in your README based on these charts:

Highlight trends in education levels across different age groups for males and females.
Note any significant differences between the cleaned data and the sample data.
For example:

Cleaned Data: The majority of individuals in all age groups have completed high school (HS-grad) or hold a bachelor’s degree. Master's and Doctorate levels are significantly less common across all age groups.
Sample Data: Similar trends as the cleaned data, but due to the smaller sample size, the representation is less diverse.
4. File Structure
Ensure the new images are stored in a well-organized folder:

Copy
Edit
Census-Data-Analysis/
├── images/
│   ├── Histogram_cd.png
│   ├── PieChart_cd.png
│   ├── barchart_cd.png
│   ├── barchart_sd.png

   - Histograms for age distribution.
   - Pie charts for profession distribution across age groups.
   - Bar charts to compare education levels by gender and age groups.

## Key Findings
- **Income Trends**: 
  - Individuals aged 41-60 dominate the `>50K` income group.
- **Profession Distribution**: 
  - Private employment is the largest sector across all age groups, while self-employment increases with age.
- **Education and Gender**:
  - Males hold a higher percentage of advanced degrees (Masters, Doctorates) compared to females, particularly in older age groups.

This project involves cleaning, analyzing, and extracting insights from a dataset about board games, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/board-games). The dataset contains information on thousands of board games, including their ratings, player requirements, playtime, and game mechanics. The objective is to explore the dataset using **Pandas** and generate meaningful insights.

---

## Objectives
1. Clean the dataset by handling missing values, invalid data, and inconsistent data types.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to answer specific questions about board games.
3. Use Python’s Pandas library to manipulate the dataset efficiently without loops or conditional statements.
4. Extract insights related to game complexity, player preferences, and domain-specific trends.

## Dataset Details
- **Source**: [Kaggle: Board Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/board-games)
- **Columns**:
  - `ID`: Unique identifier for the game.
  - `Name`: Name of the board game.
  - `Year Published`: Year the game was published.
  - `Min Players` and `Max Players`: Minimum and maximum players required for the game.
  - `Play Time`: Average playtime of the game (in minutes).
  - `Min Age`: Minimum recommended age for players.
  - `Users Rated`: Number of users who rated the game.
  - `Rating Average`: Average rating given to the game by users.
  - `BGG Rank`: BoardGameGeek ranking of the game.
  - `Complexity Average`: Average complexity score of the game.
  - `Owned Users`: Number of users who own the game.
  - `Mechanics` and `Domains`: Lists of game mechanics and domains.

## Key Tasks and Insights

### **Task 1: Handle Missing and Invalid Data**
- Identified columns with null values:
  - `ID`, `Year Published`, `Owned Users`, `Mechanics`, and `Domains`.
- Replaced missing values:
  - Used `5000` for missing years and `-1` for missing owned user counts.
- Converted data types for proper analysis.

### **Task 2: Identify Games Published Before 1900**
- Found the number of games published before 1900 (excluding year 0 as it indicates missing data).
- Example Output:
  - Total games published before 1900: **111**
  - Oldest game: **Senet**

### **Task 3: Analyze Popularity by Minimum Players**
- Computed the average ownership for games based on the `Min Players` column.
- Observed that games with fewer minimum players tend to have higher ownership.

### **Task 4: Examine Rating and Complexity**
- Created pivot tables to analyze relationships between `Rating Average` and `Complexity Average`.
- Found a positive correlation:
  - Games with higher complexity tend to have higher ratings.

### **Task 5: Explore Game Domains**
- Used one-hot encoding on the `Domains` column to determine the frequency of each domain type.
- Example Output:
  - Most common domain: **Wargames** (3316 games).
  - Least common domain: **Customizable Games** (297 games).
